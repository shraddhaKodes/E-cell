# ecell-recruitment-task

This project is my solution to the E-Cell Web-Team Recruitment Task. It is a two-page front-end website built using React.js and Tailwind CSS, focusing on interactivity, responsiveness, and creative design.

## Project Details

### Page 1: Figma Design

#### Navigation Bar:
- **Home**: Redirects to the second page.
- **Grid**: Reloads the current page.
- **LinkedIn**: Opens my LinkedIn profile in a new tab.

#### Page Content:
1. **Top Section**: A content block styled per the Figma design.
2. **Middle Section**: Displays the E-Cell logo in a container.
3. **Bottom Section**: A responsive 3x3 grid of squares:
   - Clicking a square changes its color to red.
   - **Advanced Feature**: Clicking the last square resets all squares to blue in the sequence they were previously clicked.

### Page 2: Squid Game Theme

#### Content:
- Displays:
  - My photo, name, and registration number.
  - A button redirecting to my Instagram profile.
- **Design**:
  - Inspired by the Squid Game theme with animations and creative effects.
